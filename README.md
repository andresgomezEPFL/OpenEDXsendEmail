# OpenEDXsendEmail
Small script to send Email to your students based on grade reports.

## Why?
This script was mainly created to compensate some issues we encounter with OpenEdx platform and allow us to send a report to every person sign in in the course. 

## Requirements
The script is mainly use by EXAF on a specific course but could be use by anyone using openEDX platform, it requires basic knowledge on data Analysis and uses exchange protocol (for Office 365). 

## Improvement
We see a lot of improvements possible for example the download of the file directly through the API.
